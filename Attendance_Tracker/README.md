# Attendance Tracker & Reminder System

This project is a simple Python-based application designed to track attendance for three subjects. It also sends email reminders to students when they miss a class or when attendance updates are needed. The data is stored in an Excel sheet for easy tracking and reporting.

## Features

- **Track Attendance**: Monitor and record student attendance for three subjects.
- **Excel Integration**: Attendance data is stored in an Excel sheet, making it easy to manage, modify, and access.
- **Email Reminders**: The system sends automated email reminders to students for missed classes or updates.
- **Customizable Emails**: Emails are sent from a defined address to multiple recipients.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following installed:

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Libraries**:
  - `openpyxl` (for Excel integration)
  - `smtplib` (for sending emails)
  - `email.mime` (for email formatting)

You can install dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

## How It Works

1. **Attendance Recording**: 
   - Attendance for three subjects is tracked and saved in an Excel file.
   
2. **Email Notification**:
   - If a student misses a class or an attendance update is required, an automated email is sent to the designated student emails.
   - Emails are sent from `daudivincent20@gmail.com` and notifications are sent to `rwotomiya2002@gmail.com` and `nathanopira@gmail.com`.

## Usage

### Running the Tracker

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/attendance-tracker.git
   cd attendance-tracker
   ```

2. Run the `attendance_tracker.py` script:
   ```bash
   python attendance_tracker.py
   ```

3. Ensure that your email credentials are correctly set in the script for sending notifications. Modify the email sender and recipients as needed.

### Example Excel Structure

Ensure that your Excel sheet is structured like this:

| Student Name | Subject 1 | Subject 2 | Subject 3 | Attendance Date |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| John Doe     | Present   | Absent    | Present   | 2024-09-10      |
| Jane Smith   | Present   | Present   | Absent    | 2024-09-10      |

### Email Configuration

The email sending configuration is defined in the script. Modify the email login credentials and recipients:

```python
EMAIL_ADDRESS = "daudivincent20@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_password"  # Use an app-specific password for Gmail
STUDENT_EMAILS = ["rwotomiya2002@gmail.com", "nathanopira@gmail.com"]
```
