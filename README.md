# Weather Desktop Notification

This Python script provides live weather updates by displaying notifications directly on your desktop. The script fetches weather data from an online source and sends periodic updates with the latest weather information.

## Features
- Retrieves live weather updates from the web.
- Sends desktop notifications using `win10toast`.
- Customizable for different cities.
- Lightweight and simple to use.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine. You can check if Python is installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are required to run this script:

- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch weather data.
- **beautifulsoup4 (bs4)**: For web scraping the weather information.
- **win10toast**: For creating desktop notifications.

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install them manually using the following commands:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install win10toast
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-notifier.git
   cd weather-notifier
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - **For Windows (PowerShell)**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

   - **For Windows (Command Prompt)**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

   - **For Unix/macOS**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python weather_notifier.py
   ```

## Usage

By default, the script fetches weather updates for New York City. You can modify the city by changing the `city` variable in the script to your preferred location.

```python
city = "New-York"
```

You can also update the script to accept user input for the city if desired. The script will send desktop notifications every 30 minutes with the latest weather information.

## Example

After running the script, you will see a desktop notification that looks something like this:

```
Weather Update
Weather in New-York: Light rain showers expected.
```

## Customization

You can modify the notification interval or enhance the script to fetch more detailed weather data. Feel free to customize it to suit your needs!
